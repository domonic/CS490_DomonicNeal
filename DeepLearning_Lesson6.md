In this lesson we learned about autoencoder. We learned how to implement autoencoder, reconstruction, and noise implementation 
/ removal from images while also being able to perform predictions.


PART 1: Add one more hidden layer to autoencoder

PART 2: visualize the input and reconstructed representation of the autoencoder using Matplotlib

PART 3: isualize the input, noisy input and reconstructed representation (denosed output)of the Denosing_Autoencoder using Matplotlib

PART 4: plot loss and accuracy using the history object
