In this lesson we learned how to perform analysis on images and how to predict an image based on analysis of specific images and 
then we were ultimately able to implement this using models, model fitting, vectorization, reshaping, and plotting.

Part 1: using the history object in the sourcecode, plot the loss and accuracy for both training data and validation data.

Part 2: plot one of the images in the test data, and then do inferencing to check what isthe prediction of the fitted model on 
that single image in the test data.

Psrt 3:  Try to change the number of hidden layer and the activation to tanh or sigmoid and see what happens.
