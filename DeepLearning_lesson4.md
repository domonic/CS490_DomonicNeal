In this lesson we learned how to implement and the importance of Image classification with CNN.We learned about different layers specifically Convolutional layers which are different than neural our typical layer in that they assume the input are images. 
This improves helps improve efficiency.



Part 1: Follow the instruction below and then report how the performance changed.(apply all at once)
  Original Test:
              Test loss 1.8744162601470948
              Test Accuracy: 31.97%
  After Changes:
              Test loss 2.0557794059753416
              Test Accuracy: 24.96%
              
              
Part 2: Visualize the graphand losswith TensorBoard

Part 3: Predict the first 4 image of the test data. Then, print the actual label for those 4 images 
        (label means the probability associated with them) to check if the model predicted correctly or not
