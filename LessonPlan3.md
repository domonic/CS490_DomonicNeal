In this lesson we learned object oriented programming using python as well as about the numpy module for python. 
We were able to implement classes and objects and use them to complete a certain task. We were also able to implement and see the 
functionality for web scraping and how it can and is used in data science / analytics

Task 1: 
1. Create a class Employee and then do the following
a. Create a data member to count the number of Employees
b. Create a constructor to initialize name, family, salary, department
c. Create a function to average salary
d. Create a Fulltime Employee class and it should inherit the properties of Employee class
e. Create the instances of Fulltime Employee class and Employee class and call their member functions.

Task 2:
Write a simple program that parse a Wiki page 
mentioned below and follow the instructions:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning
a. Print out the title of the page
b. Find all the links in the page (‘a’ tag)
c. Iterate over each tag(above) then return the link using attribute "href" using get

Task 3:
Using NumPy create random vector of size 15 having only Integers in the range 1-20. 
Write a program to replace the maximum value in the vector by 0.
