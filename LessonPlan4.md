1. We should keep this feature because it helps us identify those who are more likely to survive
3. The alrgorithm that I got better accuracy with was using SVM this is because in the Naive Bayes model approach the features are treated
  as independent where in SVM the features are looked at as interactions between one another. SVM is more efficient in full data context
  whereas Naive Bayes is more useful in data snippet context.
4. The kernel that I got better accuracy with was using RBF over LINEAR by about 4.08 at the time of compiling the program
