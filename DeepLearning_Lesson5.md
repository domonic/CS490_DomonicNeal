In this lesson we learned about types of ANNsand Recurrent Neural Networks. Specifically we learned about GridsearchCV how to implement 
this type of optimatization on our model and dataset.


PART 1: Save the model and use the saved model to predict on new text data (ex, “A lot of good things are happening. 
We are respected again throughout the world, and that's a great thing.@realDonaldTrump”)
        Score Sentiment: 0.7639540473854454
        Accuracy Sentiment:  0.663390126692879

PART 2: Apply GridSearchCV on the source code provided in the class
        Best: 0.675885 using {'batch_size': 20, 'epochs': 2}
        
PART 3: Apply the code on spamdata set available in the source code (text classification on the spam.csv data set)
