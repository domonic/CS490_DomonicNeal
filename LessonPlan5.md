In this lessoon we learned linear and multiple regression and how to implement the both of them in python using the numpy and pandas
modules. 


In the first half we were tasked to:

Delete all the anomaly data for the GarageArea field 
(for the same data set in the use case: House Prices).* for this task you need to plot GaurageArea field and SalePrice in scatter plot, 
then check which numbers are anomalies. 



In the second half we were tasked to:

Create Multiple Regression for the “wine quality” dataset. In this data set “quality” is the target label.
Evaluate the model using RMSE and R2 score. We need to find the top 3 most correlated features to the target label(quality).
