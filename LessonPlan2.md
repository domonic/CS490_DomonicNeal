In this lesson from the lecture we were able to impletement loops (both for and while loops), lists, functions, and dictionaries.
We were also able to perform different operations on these different python controls ultimately to accomplish different tasks. 

Our first task was to allow the user to enter N for number of students and based on this input then require the user to enter 
the weight in pounds for however many students they entered and store them into a list. We were then tasked to take each item in this
list and convert the item (pounds) for each student into kilos and then store those values into a new list and output both lists to the
screen.

Our second task was to allow the user to enter a string and then output a the user's string but only every other character within the
string. The implementation of a function was required for this task. 

Our final task was to read through a txt file and count the number of occurrences of a particular word in the file. This was able to be
accomplished with the use of dictionaries to map key, value pairs with the key being the word and value being the number of times it 
appears in the file. With this data we were then required to output the data to the screen as well as write the data back to the file.

You will find the source code for this LessonPlan as its titled "LessonPlan2.py". The source code is documented with specific explanations
of what each part is doing and the purpose it is serving.
